### The Ology Trio

Data set : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanyacodes/movies-dataset-netflix-prime-video-disney


# What's In It?

# This dataset contains information on movies available across four major streaming platforms: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and Hulu. It includes data points like: 

- Title 

- Genre(s) 

- IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes scores 

- Year of release 

- Runtime 

- Platform availability flags (True/False for each) 

The dataset is interesting because it allows us to analyze and compare streaming services based on their content catalogs, quality of available titles, and genre distribution. We can explore trends in movie ratings, exclusivity, and the evolution of content over time.

## Introduction to the Data 

# Streaming platforms have become a primary way people consume entertainment, each offering different catalogs of movies and shows. With the rise of content wars, it's increasingly important to understand how these platforms differ â€” not just in what they offer, but in the quality and diversity of their content. This dataset provides a snapshot of the movie libraries of Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and Hulu. By analyzing this data, we can identify platform-specific strengths, trends in genre and quality, and help users or businesses make informed decisions about content strategies.

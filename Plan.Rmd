```{r}

#streaming_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/ar309/AppData/Local/Temp/bd77a138-b51e-4d73-ba8a-91587158c44a_archive.zip.44a/MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms.csv")

# What's In It?

 This dataset contains information on movies available across four major streaming platforms: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and Hulu. It includes data points like: 

- Title 

- Genre(s) 

- Age Group Recommendations

- Rotten Tomatoes scores 

- Year of release 

- Runtime 

- Platform availability flags (True/False for each) 

This dataset is useful because it lets us look at and compare what each streaming service offers; like what kinds of movies they have, how good those movies are, and which genres are most common. We can also see patterns in ratings, find out which movies are only on one platform, and watch how their movie collections have changed over time.

## Introduction to the Data 

Streaming platforms are now the go-to for watching movies and shows, and each one has its own unique library. With all the competition for content, it’s more important than ever to understand what sets these platforms apart — not just in what they have, but in the quality and variety of their offerings. This dataset gives us a snapshot of what’s available on Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and Hulu. By exploring the data, we can spot each platform’s strengths, see trends in genres and quality, and help people or companies make smarter choices when it comes to content.

### Questions We Plan to Ask (and Graphs to Make) 
1. Which platform has the highest-rated content overall (based on Rotten Tomatoes scores)?

 Bar graph comparing average Rotten Tomatoes score for each platform
 
```{r}
highest_rated <- streaming_data %>% summarise(Highest=max(Rotten.Tomatoes, na.rm = TRUE))

highest_rated





```
 
 
 

2. How many titles are available on each platform?

```{r}
platform_counts <- streaming_data %>%
  summarise(
    Netflix = sum(Netflix),
    Hulu = sum(Hulu),
    Prime.Video = sum(Prime.Video),
    Disney. = sum(Disney.)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Platform", values_to = "Title_Count")

platform_counts
```

```{r}

ggplot(platform_counts, aes(x = reorder(Platform, -Title_Count), y = Title_Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") +
  labs(title = "Number of Titles per Platform", x = "Platform", y = "Title Count") +
  theme_minimal()


```

3. How has the number of titles released over time changed for each platform?

4. Which platform has the most highly rated content (RT score > 90%)?
 Bar chart showing count of high-rated titles per platform
 
 
```{r}

highly_rated <- streaming_data %>% filter(Rotten.Tomatoes > 90)

hr <- highly_rated %>%
  summarise(
    Netflix = sum(Netflix),
    Hulu = sum(Hulu),
    Prime.Video = sum(Prime.Video),
    Disney. = sum(Disney.)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Platform", values_to = "High_Rated_Count") %>%
  arrange(desc(High_Rated_Count))

hr

```

```{r}

ggplot(hr, aes(x = reorder(Platform, -High_Rated_Count), y = High_Rated_Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "tomato") +
  labs(title = "Highly Rated Content (RT > 90%) per Platform",
       x = "Platform", y = "Number of Titles") +
  theme_minimal()


```




5. How do age ratings vary across platforms?
 Grouped bar chart showing count of each age rating (e.g., PG, R) per platform
 
```{r}
#platform_age <- streaming_data %>% filter(Age) %>% select(Netflix, Hulu, Disney., Prime.Video)

#platform_age


```
 
 
 

6. Which platforms focus more on older vs. newer titles?

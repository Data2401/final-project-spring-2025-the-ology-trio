### The Ology Trio

Data set : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanyacodes/movies-dataset-netflix-prime-video-disney


# What's In It?

 This dataset contains information on movies available across four major streaming platforms: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and Hulu. It includes data points like: 

- Title 

- Genre(s) 

- Age Group Recommendations

- Rotten Tomatoes scores 

- Year of release 

- Platform availability flags (0 or 1 for each) 

- Type: A categorical indicator distinguishing the content as either a 'Movie' or a 'TV Show'.

This dataset is useful because it lets us look at and compare what each streaming service offers; like what kinds of movies they have, how good those movies are, and which genres are most common. We can also see patterns in ratings, find out which movies are only on one platform, and watch how their movie collections have changed over time.

## Introduction to the Data 

Streaming platforms are now the go-to for watching movies and shows, and each one has its own unique library. With all the competition for content, it’s more important than ever to understand what sets these platforms apart — not just in what they have, but in the quality and variety of their offerings. This dataset gives us a snapshot of what’s available on Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and Hulu. By exploring the data, we can spot each platform’s strengths, see trends in genres and quality, and help people or companies make smarter choices when it comes to content.
